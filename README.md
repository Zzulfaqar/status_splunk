Introduction to the Splunk Status Checker Script
Managing Splunk efficiently is crucial to ensuring that your system logs and monitoring tools are always available. Our Splunk Status Checker script is a simple yet effective way to quickly check if Splunk is running and take action if needed.

This script is designed to be user-friendly. When run, it will check the current status of Splunk and let you know if it's running or not. If Splunk is not running, the script will ask for your permission before starting it, ensuring that you remain in control of the process. It also prevents unnecessary restarts if Splunk is already active.

With built-in prompts and easy-to-read messages, this tool helps users keep Splunk up and running without needing technical expertise. Whether youâ€™re a system administrator or just need a simple way to check your Splunk service, this script makes the process seamless and hassle-free.
